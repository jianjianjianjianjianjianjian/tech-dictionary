## Problem Nailing Process

## Step 0: A little bit of context first
- Tactics - Strategy - Vision
- It the team has no clear vision or overall strategy, figure these things out first.

## Step 1: Crystallize the problem you are solving
### Description: What is it?
+ **Breif** description of my thinking.
### Problem: What problem is this solving?
- What do I belive the problem I am solving is, and why?<br>
- Strong problem statement include:<br>
1. **It's short.**<br>The longer explanation, the less clear problem definition.
2. **It's focused.**<br>Single clear problem(due to the time limit). Including some examples of what problem I am *not* solving could be helpful.
 3. **It references a "need" that is not being fulfilled.**<br>User need + Biz need(unnecessary). [Jobs-To-Be-Done framework](https://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca)
 4. **It includes a what and a why.**<br>What's going wrong, and what is it a problem?
 5. **It's agnostic of a solution.**<br>Try not to rush for problem solving.
 <br>

- Examples of good problem statements:<br>
1. Lyft drivers are cancelling rides too often because the passengers are too far away.<br>
2. Airbnb hosts are feeling frustrated because they want to improve, but are finding it difficult to figure out how.<br>
3. Users are dropping off at too high a rate at the final step of the signup flow.<br>

3. Users are dropping off at too high a rate at the final step of the signup flow.

### Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
- A few tips for this step:
1. **Look at both quantitative and qualitative evidence.**<br>Collect all data points that can prove this is real and important problem.
2. **Quality over quantity.**<br>The number of the data points doesn't guarantee quality.
3. **Play devil’s advocate with yourself.**<br>Try to keep asking to myself, is this evidence truly telling me what I think? What gaps do I have in my evidence?

### Success: How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?
- Ideally this is a **specific metric** w/ a defined goal, directly connects to my team's **KPI's**, based on hard data abt the **opportunity size, investment size, and a heuristic** from past experiments.
- Some advice for defining my success criteria.
+ **Try hard to make it a concrete number**<br>e.g., 10% increase in X, 50% decrease in Y, 20% adoption of feature Z within 3 months.
+ **Pick a goal that’s believable, but ambitious.**<br>What's a goal that would make my team  and my leaders would be excited abt?
+ **If you don’t think a metric makes sense for your goal, write out what concretely the world would look like if this was a big suceess**<br>Make that the success criteria.

### Audience: Who are we building for?
- New / Returning users. Casual / Power users. Moblie / Web users. etc.

### What: What does this look like in the product?
- Depending on my team's status.

## Step 2: Align on the problem with your team and stakeholders
### Problem statements are like silver burritos.

(each of us is picturing our most ideal and delicious ideal burrito insed of that silver burrito)
### Nice approach step
1. Take a crack at Step 1
2. Share the draft w/ the entire team, asking for feedback(in comments, in email, or in person). Integrate them and re-share.
3. If the feedback and the team seems aligned, great. If not, pull over together and chat through disagreements in person.
4. **Once whole team is aligned, share w/ stakeholders.***(Super important)* Team and the folks should be aligned on the same problem berfore my team get too deep into design.
5. Make sure my team has everything they need to get rolling. e.g., in-person kickoff(review the problem statement, answer any outstanding questions)

## Step 3: Keep coming back to the problem
### Dashboards are a classic "silver burrito" problem.
- A few good habits to avoid this trap
1. In every design review, make sure the designers start by reviewing the problem statement. If it’s not clear, ask “What problem are we trying to solve?”
2. In every progress update to stakeholders, review the problem statement to make sure everyone continues to be aligned on the outcome.
3. Before finalizing designs make sure to ask yourself: “Am I feeling confident this is going to solve the problem we set out to solve?”

## A final note
> "Problems never stop; they merely get exchanged and/or upgraded."
