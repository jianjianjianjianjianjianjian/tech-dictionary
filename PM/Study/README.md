### Step 1: Crystallize the problem you are solving
#### Description: What is it?
+ **Breif** description of my thinking.
#### Problem: What problem is this solving?
- What do I belive the problem I am solving is, and why?<br>
- Strong problem statement include:<br>
1. **It's short.**<br>The longer explanation, the less clear problem definition.
2. **It's focused.**<br>Single clear problem(due to the time limit). Including some examples of what problem I am *not* solving could be helpful.
 3. **It references a "need" that is not being fulfilled.**<br>User need + Biz need(unnecessary). [Jobs-To-Be-Done framework](https://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca)
 4. **It includes a what and a why.**<br>What's going wrong, and what is it a problem?
 5. **It's agnostic of a solution.**<br>Try not to rush for problem solving.
 <br>

- Examples of good problem statements:<br>
1. Lyft drivers are cancelling rides too often because the passengers are too far away.<br>
2. Airbnb hosts are feeling frustrated because they want to improve, but are finding it difficult to figure out how.<br>
3. Users are dropping off at too high a rate at the final step of the signup flow.<br>

#### Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
- A few tips for this step:
1. **Look at both quantitative and qualitative evidence.**<br>Collect all data points that can prove this is real and important problem.
2. **Quality over quantity.**<br>The number of the data points doesn't guarantee quality.
3. **Play devil’s advocate with yourself.**<br>Try to keep asking to myself, is this evidence truly telling me what I think? What gaps do I have in my evidence?

#### Success: How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?
- Ideally this is a **specific metric** w/ a defined goal, directly connects to my team's **KPI's**, based on hard data abt the **opportunity size, investment size, and a heuristic** from past experiments.
- Some advice for defining my success criteria.
+ **Try hard to make it a concrete number**<br>e.g., 10% increase in X, 50% decrease in Y, 20% adoption of feature Z within 3 months.
+ **Pick a goal that’s believable, but ambitious.**<br>What's a goal that would make my team  and my leaders would be excited abt?
+ **If you don’t think a metric makes sense for your goal, write out what concretely the world would look like if this was a big suceess**<br>Make that the success criteria.

#### Audience: Who are we building for?
- New / Returning users. Casual / Power users. Moblie / Web users. etc.

#### What: What does this look like in the product?
- Depending on my team's status.
